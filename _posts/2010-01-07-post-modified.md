Colonization  Defined 

What is Colonialization?  Colonialism is a term with many meanings as it was practised globally and in different times periods. It consists of a colony that is controlled by a colonizer. Here colonialization is the takeover of spaces,systems and thoughts and relegate them to the "colon" of the colonizer. [The colon is the place in human anatomy where  waste is gathered and stored just before excretion out of the body]. In a nutshell, all food, nutrients and fluids have been drained and digested out leaving solid remains to be passed out. Basically the colony serves as the holding place after all useful extraction for the body.

What does it look like. The general characteristics of colonialsim as practised is built on 3 pillars -named the 3 Cs. These are 1) Culture/Christianty 2) Cannons/Conflict and thereafter 3) Commerce. The sequence of the first two often interchangeable depending on the reception of the target colony. Throughout Africa, Asia and Americas colonies, these patterns have been observed, studied and recognized as the key ingredients that enable and sustain this colonialism.

and  Redefined.
Colonialism  as a term fell out and is rarely used in the 21st century, despite characteristics of the 3 Cs still existing in many instances. While  the practice of colonialization was regarded as wrong based on the oppresor/victim  status  between the two relations and violation of human rights, Independence and self rule were not always granted. Many colonies infact simply switched to designated statuses that masked the colonial nature of their existence toward acceptable names. Examples are territories, principals and collectives that currently exist. 

Neocolonialism
More specifically, in cases of independent nations, the colonial relations have endured albeit in a covert form through  mainly intimidations, assasinations and administrations. These coupled with the legacy of classic colonialism (effects of the 3C's) have placed significant barriers for self determination and independence to peoples within these former colonies.  From the physical limitations to the political, legal and financial structures, Africans have in effect been trapped in colonial prisons masquerading as states. A more apt analogy would be human zoos. It is with this understanding and the urgent need to breakaway from the ignorant notion of "independent colonies", that this site is informed.


Decolonization.
So having defined colonization, What is decolonization? It simple terms It is the practice or process of self determination that leads to the freedom and liberation from the bonds of colonial subjugation. In brief, decolonialization is the antithesis of the above 3C's and their effects.
